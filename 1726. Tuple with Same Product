/* DESCRIPTION
What is a tuple?
its basically like a list but the contents cannot be changed once it is created 
Problem:
each element has to be distinct so no dupes in the tuple
Given an array we want to find how many tuples satify the equation such that a*b=c*d
Answer:
First we want to set the loop equal to the length of the array and loop through each element in the nums array .
Then we want to loop through all the previous elements up until the i element to get each pair.Each pair we calculate the product of the two numbers and store it in prod
count[prod] is used as the counter for how many have the same product as it. 
Note that when one is found it can be setup in 8 different ways so count is not the direct answer since we can arrange it in 8 different ways and so we multiply count by 8
to give us the answer.
This is kind of a brute force approach tho
