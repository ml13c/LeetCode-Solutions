DESCRIPTION:
Given an integer n, return any array containing n unique integers such that they add up to 0.
CODE SOLUTION:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sumZero(int n) {
        vector<int> ans;
        
        // if odd we can just throw a 0
        if (!(n % 2 == 0)) {
            ans.push_back(0);
        }
        
        // add pairs to cancel out until n number reached
        for (int i = 1; i <= n / 2; i++) {
            ans.push_back(i);
            ans.push_back(-i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
We need to add up to zero. So if there is an array of size 1 we can just add zero. That takes care of the first case, then we need to handle everyother possible case. To do this
we can iterate through the size of the array with n and just have pairs of numbers being positive and negative to cancel each other out. Odd n is handled through the odd check.
